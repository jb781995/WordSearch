# WordSearch
Java software to search words with spelling errors in documents like PDF and DOCX.
Search feature in PDF and DOCX, which can search words with spelling errors. We have advanced
search features in Adobe PDF reader, but it still doesn't allow us to search words which are incorrectly
spelled. List view and Page view of this software not only helps to find the correct word, but also
words which are either spelled in the similar way or have closer index based on similar character count.
